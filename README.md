# Quick List

### To-Do App

Quick List is a to-do app built to improve my proficiency with TypeScript while also learning new React libraries. 

## Motivation

I started this project as a way to practice TypeScript and explore how to implement animations in React. Since it was my first time using TypeScript and implementing animations, I decided to build a relatively simple to-do app with basic functionality to focus on learning key concepts.


## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to implement **drag-and-drop animations** using the hello-pangea/dnd library.
- Managing **global state** with Recoil, which allowed efficient state management across components.
- Simplifying **form handling** using React Hook Form.
- Styling the app with **styled-components**, making the UI more maintainable and customizable.
